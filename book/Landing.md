# towbintools_pipeline

towbintools_pipeline is a modular pipelining tool made to streamline the analysis of *C. elegans* time lapse microscopy experiments. It includes :

- robust and human readable configuration system for reproducible image analysis pipeline
- state of the art deep learning segmentation
- tools to easily retrain and fine tune said segmentation models
- a GUI for annotating time series (i.e. molts)
- convenient plotting in jupyter notebooks with ready made functions

Head to the **Getting Started** section to learn how to [install the pipeline](https://spsalmon.github.io/towbintools_pipeline/installation/) and how to [run your first pipeline](https://spsalmon.github.io/towbintools_pipeline/runningfirstpipeline/).

You can find information on how to [customize the pipeline execution](link), [retrain models](link) or [use the GUI](link) or in the **Usage** section

The **Building Block** sections contains [detailed explanation of all the parameters of every block](link).
