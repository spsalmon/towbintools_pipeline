# Towbintools Pipeline — Maintenance Refactor — Overview (26-07-31)

A guide to what changed in the pipeline and **why**, for presenting the work and
for onboarding. It is organised by theme, not by the order things were built.

For the *cost* of each decision see [`TRADEOFFS.md`](TRADEOFFS.md); for the
running notes that feed the eventual user-docs rewrite see [`DOCS_TODO.md`](DOCS_TODO.md).
This overview file is the high-level map that ties them together. Each of the 10 themes
below carries a **Where** link to the pull request that delivered it — a `base…target`
diff on the `github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline`fork, reviewed and merged bottom-up.

## At a glance

The pipeline was a cluster-only collection of scripts: it ran only as SLURM jobs,
had to be launched from a specific place with the right paths, and cluster- and
environment-specific details were baked into the code. Adapting it, testing it,
or even running it off the cluster was hard.

It is now an **installable Python package** that runs **locally or on SLURM**
through one code path, **adapts to a new cluster by editing config alone**,
**validates its config up front**, and is **covered by automated tests that run
on every change**. The goal throughout was maintainability: make it easy to run,
easy to change safely, and easy to reason about.

## Nothing breaks — the old ways still work

None of this is a hard cut-over. Existing use keeps working:

- **Existing configs still run** — folder references may still be written with
  the old prefix, single-file configs still work, and the new validation only
  rejects genuinely broken configs.
- **The pipeline is still launched the same way** on the cluster
  (`bash scripts/run_pipeline.sh ...`), and running it directly with
  `python -m towbintools_pipeline.init_pipeline ...` still works — the new
  installed `towbintools-pipeline` command is an *addition*, not a replacement.
- **Every new behaviour that could change a run is opt-in and defaults to the
  old behaviour** — the backend defaults to SLURM, an unset launcher means the
  previous micromamba command, and the end-of-run cleanup defaults to off.

## What changed, by theme

### 1. Run it anywhere — a local backend

The pipeline can now run entirely on a machine without SLURM (`backend: local`)
through the same code path it uses on the cluster, instead of only as SLURM jobs.

**Why —** you can develop, test, debug, and demo without a cluster; this is
the foundation that made automated testing possible at all.

**Where —** [`main…feature/local-backend`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/main...feature/local-backend)

### 2. A real, installable package

Installing the project from its checkout (`pip install`) now registers a
`towbintools-pipeline` command that runs from any directory; each analysis step
runs as a proper Python module; and the default config and model ship inside the
package. (It is installed from the repository, not from a public index like PyPI
— publishing there is an easy possible later step, though.)

**Why —** reproducible installs, no path/`PYTHONPATH` juggling, and something
that can actually be distributed and onboarded.

**Where —** [`…feature/packaging-entry-point`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/chore/retire-git-self-update...feature/packaging-entry-point) (then [`refactor/deployment-layout`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/packaging-entry-point...refactor/deployment-layout), [`feature/cluster-package-install`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/refactor/deployment-layout...feature/cluster-package-install))

### 3. Not tied to one environment manager

Micromamba and a specific environment name used to be hardcoded in the code and
scripts. Now a single `python_command` config key decides how Python is launched
everywhere (with an environment-variable escape hatch), and there is a separate
local installer that needs no micromamba.

**Why —** teams can use conda, venv, micromamba — whatever they have — and new
users get a much simpler setup.

**Where —** [`…feature/launcher-decoupling`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/refactor/script-responsibilities...feature/launcher-decoupling) (the micromamba-free local install env first landed in [`feature/env-install`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/local-backend...feature/env-install))

### 4. Adapt to a new cluster by editing config, not code

SLURM resources now live in a dedicated `slurm_config.yaml` with shared defaults,
per-analysis-step overrides, and the orchestrator job's own resources, plus a
free-form list for cluster-specific flags (e.g. `--account`, `--mem-per-cpu`,
partitions) that previously required editing the code.

**Why —** moving to a different cluster, or changing account/partition/memory, is now
a change to a user file (the SLURM config) — and does not require edits to the pipeline code.

**Where —** [`…feature/slurm-config`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/env-install...feature/slurm-config) (then [`feature/slurm-per-block`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/fix/config-loading-and-backup...feature/slurm-per-block), [`feature/slurm-outer-script`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/slurm-per-block...feature/slurm-outer-script))

### 5. Simpler, less error-prone configuration

Folder references used to repeat the analysis-directory prefix everywhere, and
renaming that directory meant rewriting the config, which is tedious and error-prone.
References are now written by name, resolved automatically, and survive renaming the
output directory; the shipped default config carries commented examples for the main knobs.

**Why —** less repetition and fewer foot-guns when writing a config.

**Where —** [`…feature/folder-ref-decoupling`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/cleanup-on-success...feature/folder-ref-decoupling)

### 6. Fail fast on a bad config

A mistake in the config used to surface late — mid-run, or as a confusing error
deep inside a job. The config is now validated up front, and the run stops before
anything is created, reporting **all** the problems at once.

**Why —** mistakes are caught in seconds with clear messages, and there are no
half-started runs to clean up.

**Where —** [`…feature/config-validation-ci`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/folder-ref-decoupling...feature/config-validation-ci) (commit `821f9c4`)

### 7. Run isolation and provenance

Each run has a configurable temporary working directory. It is copied as the run's
backup into the experiment directory where it sits beside the results (not within).
An opt-in setting deletes the temporary directory after copying, and reclaims scratch
space after a successful run. Both, the experiment_dir and temporary_dir (working
directory), can be provided by a CLI falg or a config entry.

**Why —** clarity, reproducibility and flexibility in the outputs the pipeline generates.

**Where —** [`…feature/externalize-io`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/slurm-config...feature/externalize-io) (then [`chore/cleanup-and-temp-default`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/slurm-outer-script...chore/cleanup-and-temp-default), [`fix/config-loading-and-backup`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/refactor/repo-structure...fix/config-loading-and-backup), [`feature/cleanup-on-success`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/cluster-package-install...feature/cleanup-on-success))

### 8. Observability — know what ran and where it stopped

The run prints its planned sequence of steps and a start/finish marker around
each one, and keeps a single combined log that is rebuilt as the run progresses,
ending with a clear "finished" vs "still running" marker.

**Why —** users can watch progress and diagnose a stalled run from the logs alone.

**Where —** [`…feature/block-progress-logging`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/chore/cleanup-and-temp-default...feature/block-progress-logging)

### 9. A repository that explains itself

The layout is now four clear tiers — the **package** (the pipeline itself, the folder
"towbintools_pipeline"), the **deployment glue** (environment definitions + operational
scripts, the folder "env"), the **extras** (tools, GUI, training, analysis_and_plots),
and the **meta/docs/tests**. The old "auto-reset your checkout from git on every launch"
behaviour was replaced by an explicit update command.

**Why —** a newcomer can tell what each part is for, and launching a run no longer
silently changes your working copy.

**Where —** [`…refactor/repo-structure`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/externalize-io...refactor/repo-structure) (the launcher/job/Python responsibility split came in [`refactor/script-responsibilities`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/block-progress-logging...refactor/script-responsibilities); then [`refactor/deployment-layout`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/packaging-entry-point...refactor/deployment-layout), [`chore/retire-git-self-update`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/launcher-decoupling...chore/retire-git-self-update))

### 10. A safety net — tests and continuous integration

There is now an end-to-end smoke test plus unit tests for the core logic, run
automatically on every push and pull request (a green check gates changes), and a
consistent code style across the package. The CI is, for now, a minimal implementation,
but it can be easily expanded.

**Why —** this refactor itself was validated continuously, and future changes are
protected from silent regressions.

**Where —** same PR as config validation, [`…feature/config-validation-ci`](https://github.com/quasar1357/towbintools_pipeline/compare/feature/folder-ref-decoupling...feature/config-validation-ci) (commits `def211d`, `3cec1db`)

### How the work was done

Changes were made as **small, reviewable, stacked pull requests**, each containing
maximum a handful of typically small commits. Changes were tried to be made minimal
to stay **as close to the original code as possible**, and every decision that
carried a real cost was written down (see `TRADEOFFS.md`).

## Status and what's next

- **Verified on the cluster (UBELIX):** entire pipeline setup and mock analysis;
  notably packaging, the deployment-layout change, and the cluster package install,
  the config validation (surfaces its error and creates no folders), config defaults,
  slurm config adjustments, folder references (with the analysis-directory prefix
  left out the subfolders are still found), and the opt-in end-of-run cleanup.
- **Deliberately left for later:**
  - the **extras** (`tools/`, `gui/`, `training/`), yet to be adapted to the new
    layout and conventions;
  - the **user-facing documentation** (README + book) rewrite, to be done *after*
    the overhaul of the core pipeline is agreed, driven from `DOCS_TODO.md`;
  - **Optional**: Exhaustive **API enhancement**, for instance an object-oriented
    approach allowing for stepwise procedure and opt-in linking of the blocks.

## The documents, going forward

- **`REFACTOR_OVERVIEW.md`** (this file) — what changed and why.
- **`TRADEOFFS.md`** — the decision ledger: every change that cost something,
  split into *introduced by this refactor* and *inherited and consciously kept*.
  For asking questions like "why did we do X, and what did it cost?"
- **`DOCS_TODO.md`** — the working feedstock for the eventual user-docs rewrite,
  plus the agreed code conventions. Drives the docs step.
- **`OUTLOOK.md`** — forward-looking notes: the future-work index and the
  engineering/design cleanups consciously deferred.
