# Build the `towbintools` environment WITHOUT ever mutating the live env folder.
#
# Why this exists:
#   `micromamba create/install` updates the env folder IN PLACE. When it has to
#   remove a file that is busy (a lingering background process, a Jupyter kernel,
#   an NFS handle), the transaction fails half-way and leaves the env corrupted —
#   most files deleted, no longer a valid conda prefix — forcing a manual rm -rf.
#
# How this avoids it:
#   Every build goes into a brand-new, never-busy, timestamped prefix
#   (envs/towbintools_<timestamp>). A stable `envs/towbintools` SYMLINK is then
#   flipped to point at it. micromamba resolves `-n towbintools` through the
#   symlink, so all the hardcoded `micromamba run -n towbintools ...` calls keep
#   working. A failed build leaves the previous env untouched, and busy files in
#   old versions are never in the deletion path of an update.
#
# Usage: build_env.sh            (build fresh + switch over)
