# Regenerate the lock files from environment.yml.
#
# Two files are produced and BOTH are committed:
#   - conda-lock.yml        canonical conda-lock solve (render input, source of truth)
#   - conda-linux-64.lock   explicit render -> the file install/update actually consume
#
# install_pipeline.sh and update_pipeline.sh both read conda-linux-64.lock in two
# phases: micromamba installs the conda packages from it, and pip installs the pip
# packages from its `# pip <name> @ <url>#sha256=...` comment lines. Keeping conda
# and pip separate avoids combined-transaction failures when files are held open by
# running jobs or a Jupyter kernel.
#
# We deliberately do NOT render the `env` kind (conda-linux-64.lock.yml): it used to
# be depended on, then stopped being generated, which silently broke env updates.
